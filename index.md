# About me

Welcome! I am a researcher in computational biology / bioinformatics with a focus on contriving new methods in means to de-convolute [_omics_-data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omics).

Here is my [CV](_docs/CV2023.pdf)

This page serves as my personal portfolio, and I publish whatever I feel like on it. This may be my latest articles, posts or code-repositories. It's open for everyone, but is partly for myself to keep track of things I have scattered all over the web.
